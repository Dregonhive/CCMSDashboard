# CCMSDashboard
A simple dashboard prototype simulating a Car Crash Management System for the authorities.

The whole system is composed of this dashboard plus:
  - a mobile application targeted for the populations that serves as a way for them to signal nearby accidents and to be notified of nearby accidents.
  - a mobile application for reporting, targeted towards the civil workers.
  - a RESTful backend server tying all 3 parts together.

The Dashboard is just a prototype desktop application made using Java/JavaFX.

This was part of a school project assignment (and was done under the name of a fictive company "GeniusByte").
